NOTES

-----

fwilson:  look very closely at what are the most annoying and frustrating
          aspects of the current model and focus on features that remove them
-----

sipa:     never put github usernames in commits

-----

laanwj:   Release notes should refer to the RPC help for details instead of
          substituting for full documentation.
          Example: "Please refer to the RPC help of `getbalances` for details."

How to turn debug=net on with the logging rpc:

Static fully valid pubkey in the Core codebase to reference in unit tests:

  <sipa> use the generator
  <sipa> 0x0279BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798
  <sipa> with secret key 0x0000....000013
  <sipa> it's hardcoded in secp256k1
  <instagibbs> functional test harness has static keys for quick reference when wallet isn't compiled in
  <MarcoFalke> ADDRESS_BCRT1_UNSPENDABLE or self.nodes[i].get_deterministic_priv_key().address
