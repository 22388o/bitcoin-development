laanwj:   Focus on user problems, actual bugs, and "used, but untested" methods
          that affect outcomes and need tests

          What kind of frustrates me, personally, is that we didn't manage to
          clearly separate out the consensus parts. Not to a library (which
          would be useful for rust-bitcoin et al), but also not even to a
          separate directory.

          Use Clang formatting to clean up a file:
          clang-format -i src/test/fuzz/locale.cpp

          To format the last commit with 0 lines of context, call the
          clang-format-diff.py script from root as follows:
          git diff -U0 HEAD~1.. | ./contrib/devtools/clang-format-diff.py -p1 -i -v

          To test compiler acceptance on the command line:
          echo 'int main() {  }' | g++ -x c++ -

          Examples:
          echo 'int main(){ const int min_depth = { true ? 1 : 0 };}' | g++ -x c++ -
          echo 'int main(){ const int min_depth   { true ? 1 : 0 };}' | g++ -x c++ -
          echo 'int main(){ const int min_depth =   true ? 1 : 0  ;}' | g++ -x c++ -
          echo 'int main(){ const int min_depth =   true ? 1 : 0   }' | g++ -x c++ -

          Git stuff

          To search for a term in git history:
          git log -S 'some string'

          To see the git log of a function over time:
          git log -L:function:file.c

          This works for any line range as well:
          git log -L 120,130:file.h

          To see moved-only code:
          git show --color-moved=dimmed-zebra

          Word diff:
          git diff --word-diff

          Git diff that ignores all added lines having a matching identical
          removed line. An empty result proves that a diff is only moving lines:
          git diff 3f95fb0~1..3f95fb0 | grep -E '^[+-][^+-]' | cut -b2- | sort \
          | uniq -c | grep -v '^ *2'

          git grep -iE '[^0-9a-z]520[^0-9a-z]' -- '*.cpp' '*.h'
          grep -rnw './depends' -e 'http:'

          git grep -l VARINT | xargs sed -i 's/VARINT(\([^,]\+\), VarIntMode::DEFAULT)/VARINT(\1\)/'
          git diff HEAD^

          git range-diff master PREV NEW

          PREV=317bf6a NEW=ab8a6cd && diff <(git show $PREV) <(git show $NEW)

          git blame src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp | cut -c 39-65 | sort | uniq -c | sort -g

          grepping rpc output:
          bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | grep 'mapped_as' | sort

          To check each commit when feeling patient:
          git rebase -i $(git merge-base HEAD origin/master)"
          change all the picks to edit, then
          "make -j12 && make -j5 check && (cd ../test/functional;
          ./test_runner.py) && git rebase --continue

          and try this to have all of those edits filled for you:
          git rebase -i $(git merge-base HEAD master) -x "<command>"

          Verify a revert
          from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18588#pullrequestreview-391760193

          Unit tests

          Info: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/README.md

          Help: test_bitcoin --help
          or:   src/test/test_bitcoin --help

          Run all tests with make check, test_bitcoin, or src/test/test_bitcoin

          To run a suite: test_bitcoin -t suite_name   (using -t or --run_test=)
          (for example)   test_bitcoin -t wallet_tests
          or              test_bitcoin -t ismine_tests

          To run a test:  test_bitcoin -t suite_name/case_name
          (for example)   test_bitcoin -t wallet_tests/ListCoins
                          test_bitcoin -t ismine_tests/ismine_standard

          Run QT unit tests with: src/qt/test/test_bitcoin-qt

          Specify the log level with -l or --log_level= (see --help).
          Options: all|success|test_suite|unit_scope|message|warning|error|
                   cpp_exception|system_error|fatal_error|nothing
          Most useful: all, success, test_suite

          The test logs to a debug log file (in master)
          If you need temporary printing, you can do std::cout or std::cerr
          or BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE();
-----

          Functional tests

          To profile:  python3 -m cProfile -s time feature_block.py

          To run a functional test X times and print the run times:
          for i in {1..20}; do ./test/functional/mempool_updatefromblock.py | grep -o 'in [0-9]\.[0-9]*'; done


          PDB (Python debugger)

          Add break points to manually run RPC commands with:
          import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

          To attach a python debugger if test fails, run the test and pass --pdbonfailure:
          test/functional/wallet_basic.py --pdbonfailure

          Does not work via the test runner, e.g. this prints dots ad infinitum:
          test/functional/test_runner.py wallet_basic --pdbonfailure

          To run a functional test X times and launch the debugger on failure:
          (for i in {1..100}; do test/functional/wallet_basic.py --pdbonfailure ; done)

          Put error messages in the assertion instead of print to stdout. See:
          https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18516#discussion_r404191587
          raise AssertionError("Error: Invalid vsize of {}".format(tx["vsize"]))

          To run functional tests in the gui, pass BITCOIND=bitcoin-qt

          Fuzz tests

          Help: pass with -help=1 argument:
          src/test/fuzz/process_messages -help=1

          Documentation
          https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html

          Source code
          https://llvm.org/doxygen/FuzzerMutate_8h_source.html

          Compile with Clang:
          CC=clang CXX=clang++ ./configure --enable-fuzz --with-sanitizers=address,fuzzer,undefined
          May need to run `make distclean` first.

          Run an individual fuzz test:
          src/test/fuzz/base_encode_decode

          You can supply a folder where to put the seeds:
          mkdir -p process_messages/
          src/test/fuzz/process_messages process_messages/

          If you inspect the seeds manually with cat, be sure to pass in
          `cat --show-nonprinting` otherwise it might execute arbitary code
          in your terminal:
          cat --show-nonprinting ./where/to/put/the/seeds/000fff

          Run all fuzz tests with the test runner (not working; for the CI):
          ./test/fuzz/test_runner.py
-----

          Memory profiling:

          Use valgrind + massif_visualizer, ideally in a controlled environment,
          e.g. regtest, a small block chain, a custom wallet, etc. Valgrind is
          much more precise, fine-grained analysis than a handmade python
          procutils script (at the cost of being slow).

          strace - man page strace

          With these tools, run them in one terminal buffer, while performing
          operations under test (say, loading/unloading the wallet) in another
          terminal buffer.

          Valgrind Memcheck incantations (WIP)

          make check-valgrind


Run to the end and generate suppressions:

valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --show-reachable=yes --gen-suppressions=all --error-limit=no -s --suppressions=contrib/valgrind.supp src/test/test_bitcoin --log_level=test_suite

Exit on first error:

valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --show-reachable=yes --gen-suppressions=all --exit-on-first-error=yes --error-exitcode=1 -s --suppressions=contrib/valgrind.supp src/test/test_bitcoin --log_level=test_suite



valgrind --gen-suppressions=all --quiet --error-exitcode=1 --suppressions=contrib/valgrind.supp src/test/test_bitcoin -t util_tests/test_LockDirectory

valgrind --gen-suppressions=all --quiet --error-exitcode=1 --suppressions=contrib/valgrind.supp src/test/test_bitcoin -t ismine_tests/ismine_standard


valgrind --gen-suppressions=all --error-exitcode=1 --suppressions=contrib/valgrind.supp src/test/test_bitcoin -t wallet_tests --log_level=test_suite

valgrind --gen-suppressions=all --verbose --exit-on-first-error=yes --error-exitcode=1 --suppressions=contrib/valgrind.supp src/test/test_bitcoin -t wallet_tests --log_level=test_suite


valgrind --gen-suppressions=all --quiet --error-exitcode=1 --suppressions=contrib/valgrind.supp src/test/test_bitcoin -t wallet_tests/ListCoins

Best so far, good for running all tests:

valgrind --gen-suppressions=all --verbose --exit-on-first-error=yes --error-exitcode=1 --suppressions=contrib/valgrind.supp --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all src/test/test_bitcoin --log_level=test_suite

          Sipa on annotations vs assertions: they're somewhat orthogonal

          Annotations:

          [+] Compile-time check. Guarantees absence of issues in every possible code path.
          [-] Only works in Clang.
          [-] Can't be used in some more advanced locking scenarios.

          Assertions:

          [+] Works in GCC and Clang
          [+] Isn't restricted to analyzable cases
          [-] Is only a runtime check; it needs test cases that actually exercise the bug
          [-] Needs building with -DDEBUG_LOCKORDER

          Perhaps at some point it's time to evaluate if we can pick just one
          over the other (which I guess would be the annotations approach), but
          they're not exactly identical.

          Using sudo:
          sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-0.19.0/bin/*

          Using su:
          su -c 'install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-0.19.0/bin/*'
-----

          LogPrintf vs LogPrint:

          LogPrintf() logs the output into the debug.log file.

          LogPrint() only logs to the debug.log file
          (or to stdout if -printtoconsole has been enabled)
          when the corresponding -debug category is enabled.

gmaxwell: Avoid doing review that is inconsistent or focused on minutia or code
          style, especially if it comes across as oppressive rather than
          enabling.

          Ignore the smallest of nits, make style advice in a purely advisory
          way (as in, feel free to adjust if you happen to rebase, otherwise
          don't bother), move style adjustments -- if any -- until right before
          merging and not as soon as a PR opens. We've operated in that fashion
          before and I think the project accomplished a lot more at that time
          and was more enjoyable. (Likely not all due to coding style nits, but
          I would be surprised if it wasn't a factor.)

          I reiterate: the background level of refactors, style changes,
          cleanups, and other related activity is actively repelling multiple
          long term contributors, myself included. I beg: give it a bit of a
          rest, we have so many other things that are crying for our attention
          and our resolve. We should try to find some initiatives that we all
          feel more excited about, success with them would make it easier to
          work on other things... but right now a big style change is just not a
          unifying effort.

sipa:     One easy way to make sure you have all the call sites is to rename it.

          If your end goal is integrating things into Bitcoin Core,
          getting familiar with the code is the best way to spend time.
          To do that (which i very much encourage you to!) I think it's better
          to focus on one piece at a time and actually integrate it.

          Never put GitHub usernames in commits, nor PR descriptions which are
          automatically copied into merge commits.

practicalswift: Use `std::unique_ptr` (C++11) where possible.

          Rationale:
          1. Avoid resource leaks, e.g. forgetting to `delete` an object created using `new`
          2. Avoid undefined behaviour (specifically: double `delete`)

          From doc/developer-notes.md:

          - Use the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) paradigm where
            possible. For example, by using `unique_ptr` for allocations in a
            function. Rationale: This avoids memory and resource leaks, and
            ensures exception safety.

          - Use `MakeUnique()` to construct objects owned by `unique_ptr`s.
            Rationale: `MakeUnique` is concise and ensures exception safety in
            complex expressions. `MakeUnique` is a temporary project-local
            implementation of `std::make_unique` (C++14).

          On unique_ptr vs shared_ptr:

          promag: Why not use unique_ptr? I don't see sharing of message
          ownership.

          jonasschnelli: I think shared is fine here and does allow more
          flexible handling in future with little cost (ref counting).

          gmaxwell: Adding an extra memory allocation for every network message
          isn't free. I'm concerned that we may be falling into overusing
          sharedptr "just in case", which is bad because it leaks performance in
          a diffuse way that doesn't show up well in profiles. Please don't use
          sharedptr where unique will work. If something new comes in in the
          future that needs a sharedptr then we can switch then.

          sipa: unique_ptr and shared_ptr have the same number of allocations
          (if make_shared is used, at least), though shared_ptr uses more memory
          (both for the pointer itself and for the allocated memory), and has
          atomics to update the refcounts (which may reduce performance). To be
          clear, I agree we should avoid shared_ptr unless there is a good
          reason.

          jonasschnell: The reason why I used shared_ptr over unique_ptr is the
          polymorphism I'd like to use for the net messages and I once read that
          shared_ptr are recommended for polymorphic inheritance. However, I
          changed this PR now to use unique_ptr.

harding   Idea: sendrawtransaction spends from cold wallet with network disabled
          to do a final inspection of the transaction in local mempool (mainly
          to check not forgetting an output and spending everything in fees).
          Before that try testmempoolaccept, and analyzepsbt before even
          broadcasting it.

laanwj:   Release notes should refer to the RPC help for details instead of
          substituting for full documentation. Example:
          "Please refer to the RPC help of `getbalances` for details."

Static fully valid pubkey in the Core codebase to reference in unit tests:

sipa       Use the generator
           0x0279BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798
           with secret key 0x0000....000013, it's hardcoded in secp256k1

instagibbs functional test harness has static keys for quick reference when
