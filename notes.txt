laanwj:   Focus on user problems, actual bugs, and "used, but untested" methods
          that affect outcomes and need tests

          What kind of frustrates me, personally, is that we didn't manage to
          clearly separate out the consensus parts. Not to a library (which
          would be useful for rust-bitcoin et al), but also not even to a
          separate directory.

          Unit tests

          Info: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/README.md

          Help: src/test/test_bitcoin --help

          Run all tests with make check or src/test/test_bitcoin

          To run a suite: src/test/test_bitcoin -t suite_name
          (for example)   src/test/test_bitcoin -t wallet_tests
          or              src/test/test_bitcoin -t ismine_tests

          To run a test:  src/test/test_bitcoin -t suite_name/case_name
          (for example)   src/test/test_bitcoin -t wallet_tests/ListCoins
                          src/test/test_bitcoin -t ismine_tests/ismine_standard

          Run QT unit tests with: src/qt/test/test_bitcoin-qt

          Specify the log level with -l or --log_level= (see --help).
          Options: all|success|test_suite|unit_scope|message|warning|error|
                   cpp_exception|system_error|fatal_error|nothing
          Most useful: all, success, test_suite

          The test logs to a debug log file (in master)
          If you need temporary printing, you can do std::cout or std::cerr
-----

          Functional tests

          To profile:  python3 -m cProfile -s time feature_block.py

          PDB (Python debugger)

          Frequently add break points to manually run RPC commands with:
          import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

          To launch the Python debugger on failure of a functional test, pass
          `--pdbonfailure` as seen in, say, test/functional/wallet_basic.py -h

          test/functional/wallet_basic.py --pdbonfailure

          Does not work via the test runner, e.g. this prints dots ad infinitum:
          test/functional/test_runner.py wallet_basic --pdbonfailure

          To run a functional test X times and launch the debugger on failure:

          (for i in {1..100}; do test/functional/wallet_basic.py --pdbonfailure ; done)

          To run functional tests in the gui, pass BITCOIND=bitcoin-qt
-----

          Fuzz tests

          Compile with Clang:

          CC=clang CXX=clang++ ./configure --enable-fuzz --with-sanitizers=address,fuzzer,undefined

          Run all fuzz tests using the test runner: ./test/fuzz/test_runner.py

-----
          Memory profiling:

          Use valgrind + massif_visualizer, ideally in a controlled environment,
          e.g. regtest, a small block chain, a custom wallet, etc. Valgrind is
          much more precise, fine-grained analysis than a handmade python
          procutils script (at the cost of being slow).

          strace - man page strace

          With these tools, run them in one terminal buffer, while performing
          operations under test (say, loading/unloading the wallet) in another
          terminal buffer.
-----

          To build Bitcoin with Clang for better errors/use less resources,
          optionally with --enable-werror to highlight and halt on first error
          or CXXFLAGS flags like:

gmaxwell: Avoid doing review that is inconsistent or focused on minutia or code
          style, especially if it comes across as oppressive rather than
          enabling.

          Ignore the smallest of nits, make style advice in a purely advisory
          way (as in, feel free to adjust if you happen to rebase, otherwise
          don't bother), move style adjustments -- if any -- until right before
          merging and not as soon as a PR opens. We've operated in that fashion
          before and I think the project accomplished a lot more at that time
          and was more enjoyable. (Likely not all due to coding style nits, but
          I would be surprised if it wasn't a factor.)

          I reiterate: the background level of refactors, style changes,
          cleanups, and other related activity is actively repelling multiple
          long term contributors, myself included. I beg: give it a bit of a
          rest, we have so many other things that are crying for our attention
          and our resolve. We should try to find some initiatives that we all
          feel more excited about, success with them would make it easier to
          work on other things... but right now a big style change is just not a
          unifying effort.

sipa:     One easy way to make sure you have all the call sites is to rename it.

          If your end goal is integrating things into Bitcoin Core,
          getting familiar with the code is the best way to spend time.
          To do that (which i very much encourage you to!) I think it's better
          to focus on one piece at a time and actually integrate it.

          "I'm not sure the change from const std::string& to std::string&&
          is an improvement. You also now can't call SetInternalName with
          an lvalue (plain variable or reference). This is now an error:

          std::string name = "something";
          SetInternalName(name);

          "People get confused about this stuff, but if the goal is to just
          move-enable SetInternalName, it should take plain std::string,
          not const std::string&, and not std::string&&.

          "If a function just needs to read an argument (and not manipulate it
          before throwing it away or move it into a data structure) it should
          take const T&.

          "If a function wants to give callers the option of moving from an
          argument but still allow copies, it should take plain T.

          "If a function wants to force callers to move it should take T &&."

practicalswift: Use `std::unique_ptr` (C++11) where possible.

          Rationale:
          1. Avoid resource leaks, e.g. forgetting to `delete` an object created using `new`
          2. Avoid undefined behaviour (specifically: double `delete`)

          From doc/developer-notes.md:

          - Use the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) paradigm where
            possible. For example, by using `unique_ptr` for allocations in a
            function. Rationale: This avoids memory and resource leaks, and
            ensures exception safety.

          - Use `MakeUnique()` to construct objects owned by `unique_ptr`s.
            Rationale: `MakeUnique` is concise and ensures exception safety in
            complex expressions. `MakeUnique` is a temporary project-local
            implementation of `std::make_unique` (C++14).
-----

          On unique_ptr vs shared_ptr:

          promag: Why not use unique_ptr? I don't see sharing of message
          ownership.

          jonasschnelli: I think shared is fine here and does allow more
          flexible handling in future with little cost (ref counting).

          gmaxwell: Adding an extra memory allocation for every network message
          isn't free. I'm concerned that we may be falling into overusing
          sharedptr "just in case", which is bad because it leaks performance in
          a diffuse way that doesn't show up well in profiles. Please don't use
          sharedptr where unique will work. If something new comes in in the
          future that needs a sharedptr then we can switch then.

          sipa: unique_ptr and shared_ptr have the same number of allocations
          (if make_shared is used, at least), though shared_ptr uses more memory
          (both for the pointer itself and for the allocated memory), and has
          atomics to update the refcounts (which may reduce performance). To be
          clear, I agree we should avoid shared_ptr unless there is a good
          reason.

          jonasschnell: The reason why I used shared_ptr over unique_ptr is the
          polymorphism I'd like to use for the net messages and I once read that
          shared_ptr are recommended for polymorphic inheritance. However, I
          changed this PR now to use unique_ptr.

harding   Idea: sendrawtransaction spends from cold wallet with network disabled
          to do a final inspection of the transaction in local mempool (mainly
          to check not forgetting an output and spending everything in fees).
          Before that try testmempoolaccept, and analyzepsbt before even
          broadcasting it.

GETDATA issues...

219 2019-05-11T20:48:22  <gmaxwell> gleb: sdaftuar: uh, is random fetch ordering putting more stress on orphan handling?  The INVs we get from peers are usually in dependency order. That makes us fetch in dependency order, and thus the results we get back end up being mostly in dependency order.
220 2019-05-11T20:48:42  <gmaxwell> With the random ordering I think we're breaking that.
221 2019-05-11T20:50:43  <sdaftuar> gmaxwell: i asked you that question! :P
222 2019-05-11T20:50:52  <sdaftuar> but yeah, i dunno, i wonder the same
223 2019-05-11T20:52:07  <gmaxwell> oh. you did? damn
224 2019-05-11T20:52:13  <gmaxwell> sorry, fishbrain here.
225 2019-05-11T20:52:48  <gmaxwell> Well, I noticed more use of the orphanmap in my logs which is what caused me to ask the question, so I so I believe the answer is yes.
226 2019-05-11T20:52:59  <gmaxwell> :-/
227 2019-05-11T20:53:04  <gmaxwell> this is annoying
228 2019-05-11T20:53:29  <sdaftuar> i think it at least seems we gave this insufficient thought before merging #14897, so if you have reason to believe it's making things worse, i certainly believe it
229 2019-05-11T20:53:32  <gribble> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14897 | randomize GETDATA(tx) request order and introduce bias toward outbound by naumenkogs Ã‚Â· Pull Request #14897 Ã‚Â· bitcoin/bitcoin Ã‚Â· GitHub
230 2019-05-11T20:53:50  <gmaxwell> it's not so much a problem but the orphan map is limited in size and its expiration process is random, so you really don't want to be using it 'by default'
231 2019-05-11T20:56:39  <gmaxwell> one answer to this would be to just improve the orphan map behavior.

171 2019-05-14T13:46:37  <sdaftuar> gmaxwell: regarding the orphan transaction issue and the getdata randomization behavior-- it looks to me like we (a) do not put any delay on getdata requests for outbound peers announcing a tx for the first time and (b) have a fixed delay for inbound peers announcing a tx for the first time
173 2019-05-14T13:48:09  <sdaftuar> gmaxwell: so i think in the case of a peer announcing a set of transactions that are new to us, we'll request those transactions in dependency order from that peer, except if an inbound peer's announcement is partially supserseded by a later announcement from an outbound peer for a subset of the transactions
174 2019-05-14T13:48:31  <sdaftuar> gmaxwell: so that seems like it should be a relatively small effect (and is an effect we have to some degree already)

Slow getrawmempool...

<gmaxwell> getrawmempool verbose is astonishingly slow, a PR just went in to make it faster but it is still astonishgly slow.
137 2019-05-17T08:52:54  <gmaxwell> I am reasonably confident that it was not anywhere near this slow last time the mempools were big.
138 2019-05-17T08:53:21  <gmaxwell> This change in aug 2017 made all the univalue additions quadratic: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/univalue/commit/ceb1194137421afba01e8c1042bf75f3a2cdddc3 (which probably makes a number of our other RPCs slow too), but the changes works around it.
