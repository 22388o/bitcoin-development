OBSERVED TODOS

Last updated: 2020-01-17

-----
laanwj:    focus on user problems, actual bugs,
           and "used, but untested" methods that affect outcomes and need tests
-----
           jnewbery:
           enable wallet tests to mock nodes without current heavy node setup,
           e.g. separate the wallet from the node more in the test framework.
-----

           - ASmap: (a) asmap init earlier
                    (b) communicate state via an rpc (which one?)
                    (c) extract init code to testable function, write unit tests?

-----
           Labels

           - Add arg for case-indifferent search in:
             - RPC getaddressesbylabel
             - RPC listtransactions

           - RPC getaddressesbylabel: (a) remove purpose field in the response?
                                      (b) empty json object instead of error if none?

           - RPC listreceivedbylabel: add returning the number of txns per label

           - Allow passing an array of addresses:
             - RPC setlabel

           - Allow passing an array of labels:
             - RPC setlabel
             - RPC getnewaddress
             - RPC importaddress
             - RPC addmultisigaddress
             - RPC importprivkey
             - RPC importpubkey
             - RPC importmulti

           - Handle an array of labels:
             - RPC listtransactions (output an array)
             - RPC listreceivedbylabel (filter on array of strings)

             Multilabels meeting notes
             http://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/bitcoin-core-dev/2020/bitcoin-core-dev.2020-01-17-19.00.log.html

             <achow101> I think purpose is separate from labels (so seems ok to
             rm from getaddressesbylabel response).

             <meshcollider> Have you thought about whether the GUI display would
             display all labels for each address?

             <achow101> concept ack multiple labels on things
             <meshcollider> Yep supporting multiple labels makes logical sense
             to me

             <achow101> keep in mind api compatibility though,  every place we
             take a label will need to be able to tae both a string and array of
             strings otherwise we lose compatibility. same with output. that
             could be problematic.

             <meshcollider> Is "purpose" able to be set by the user currently or
             does it just default to "receive" automatically?

             <achow101> meshcollider: I don't think it's user accessible. it's
             "receive", "send", or "". "" is how we determine change.

           - reply to gregory sanders re my review, or add a follow-up PR

           - write a follow-up PR to achow's psbt shuffle PR

           - review Chris Stewart's prop-based tests and mzumsande's PR

           - look at allocators in validation, since they take lots of memory;

           - achow: "export blockchain + import with and without validating
           would be super nice as menu items"

           - fix RPCExamples (example has no args) for: getnewaddress,

             getwalletinfo)

           - add logging to wallet_bumpfee.py

           In doc/reduce-traffic.md, is this still correct? "By default, Bitcoin
           Core allows up to 125 connections to different peers, 8 of which are
           outbound. You can therefore, have at most 117 inbound connections."

           - add missing "regtest" to bottom of output when running:
             bitcoin-cli -? or bitcoin-cli -h

           - fix bitcoin-cli logging "none" option, update the help, and add
             regression tests for this and the "validation" option. Do we need
             other logging tests? Maybe a general file?

           - in wallet/rpcwallet.cpp, DRY out repeated coincontrol sections
             lines 423 and 877:
    ```
    UniValue subtractFeeFromAmount(UniValue::VARR);
    if (!request.params[4].isNull())
        subtractFeeFromAmount = request.params[4].get_array();

2019-11-13 BlueMatt: #16323 and #16324 are up for grabs if anyone wants to work
           on them, but there seems to be ~zero interest in reviewing them,
           cause they have wonderfully scary titles (despite the code actually
           being pretty simple)
           - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16323
             Call ProcessNewBlock() asynchronously
           - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16324
             Get cs_main out of the critical path in ProcessMessages

           jamesob: I'm very interested in that project, just having a hard time
           getting a sense of the end goal (though haven't looked at them
           recently). I'll give them a look in the next few weeks and maybe
           write up some kind of explanation.

           BlueMatt: oh it got cleaned up a lot, those two prs, by themselves,
           where essentially an end-goal, some of the earlier work was a mess

2019-10-05 Address the todo described in src/wallet/wallet.cpp:1131
           // TODO: Store all versions of the transaction, instead of just one.

           and remove the extra space in src/wallet/wallet.cpp:1139 as seen in
           bitcoind log output before "new" or "update":
           "2019-10-05T17:18:34Z [default wallet] AddToWallet <hash>  update"

2019-10-02 Fix remaining nits in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16727
-----

2019-09-30 Explore optimization in and around the UTXO hash data structure:
           "it might be possible to regain the performance loss by caching the
           hash ourselves. We have some padding in the maps' key, and it might
           be possible to use these bytes to store the hash value (or at least 4
           bytes of it) without having to increase the memory."

2019-09-26 instagibbs: can someone point me to where parallel block fetch code
           is/gets activated? I only see references to it in non-parallel fetch
           code via grepping

           sdaftuar: FindNextBlocksToDownload() is the relevant code. It's
           invoked in SendMessages for each peer. The code is not written in a
           way to make this obvious, but the "activation" comes from syncing
           headers with a peer -- that allows us to download blocks from that
           peer but the "activation" comes from syncing headers with a peer --
           that allows us to download blocks from that peer. There are delays
           (for a node starting up) around how quickly we will sync headers with
           each peer.

           instagibbs: Even a comment saying "parallel" would have been helpful :D

           jamesob: Here is the logic that ensures we're downloading at most
           (MAX_BLOCKS_IN_TRANSIT_PER_PEER * num_peers) simultaneously:
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net_processing.cpp#L4017-L4020
           Download happens in parallel because queuing the GETDATA messages
           isn't blocking, and `SendMessages()` is invoked in a loop for each
           peer.

2019-09-17 If PR 16512 is merged, make a follow-up PR to extract the manual
           copy+shuffling to a member function of PartiallySignedTransaction,
           cover it with unit tests and address remaining nits as per my review:
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16512#pullrequestreview-283522359

           Perhaps look at if the test added in that PR for joinpsbt inequality
           in rpc_psbt.py can be improved.
-----

2019-09-17 Move gettransaction tests from wallet_basic.py to their own file, and
           extend/improve them by checking all the values and not just the keys.
-----

2019-09-17 Split the wallet_basic.py tests out to separate functions and add
           logging where missing. Same for any of the test files...

2019-09-06 Add code documentation to src/versionbits.cpp as per discussion here:

           <MarcoFalke> bits can be reused as long as they don't overlap in time

           <aj> 16713 is updated as of a few hours to be even simpler; i think
           it lets us reuse bits fine?

           <achow101> my understanding of how consensus.vDeployments worked was
           that you couldn't define two forks with the same bit since they'd
           have to occupy the same index position and that's not possible

           <MarcoFalke> oh, maybe you are right when it comes to the
           implementation. Though, BIP9 does allow it

           <wumpus> BIP9 definitely allows it, that was an important part of the
           design

           <aj> achow101: vDeployments just matches the enum, the actual bits
           used are independant, and just have to not overlap per their
           corresponding timestamps

           <sipa> i haven't looked at the code in a while, but it was certainly
           intended to permit reuse of bits

           <sipa> the deployments array index is independent from the bip9 bit
           position

           <instagibbs> yep

           <aj> achow101: see VersionBitsConditionChecker::Mask in
           versionbits.cpp, it pulls out the .bit field from the BIP9Deployment
           struct

           <achow101> i'm probably wrong

           <instagibbs> It was confusing the first time I read it, I came to
           the same wrong conclusion

           <aj> achow101: there's also a unit test for overlapping bit usage on
           mainnet in src/test/versionbits_tests.cpp, "Verify that the
           deployment windows of [...]"

           <wumpus> if even experienced developers get confused by it, some
           documentation/comments might help in that case.

           <MarcoFalke> I think it shouldn't matter in practice, hopefully there
           are less than 27 softforks in the future.

           <wumpus> given that 'the future' is unbounded, that's a difficult
           statement.

2019-08-12 Improve tooltip info in wallet-qt GUI:

           IRC #bitcoin question: "In the options for Bitcoin Core (GUI), what's
           'Allow incoming connections' for?  It's checked by default. The
           tooltip just repeats the text for the label. Can you *not* allow
           incoming connections? Won't that make Bitcoin not work?"

           IRC reply: "you have to enable listening to allow incomming
           connections. Also you will probably need to setup your router
           accordingly. If listening connections are not enabled, your node by
           itself only creates outgoing connections to other bitcoin nodes that
           has listening enabled."

2019-07-31 Test coverage of our networking code - Who is working on this?
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14210

           theuni: the idea is to be able to run multiple networking instances
           inside of one bitcoind process. It would be trivial to implement (I
           have it done in an ancient branch somewhere) the logic to spoof
           connection data inside of CConnman in order to simulate different
           test conditions. Phony IPs, fake latency, dropped packets, peer
           selection algorithm changes, etc. That's how these tests SHOULD
           work. Spinning up entire instances of bitcoind just to test net
           behavior is overkill. Time and energy would be better spent on
           finishing up the isolated CConnman instantiation.

           dongcarl: A minimal, motivating test case that should make the rest
           very easy. Here's what we came up with:

           - Instantiate a CConnman (call it c1) with a huge nSendBufferMaxSize
           - Instantiate a CConnman (call it c2) with a tiny nReceiveFloodSize
           - Start sending messages from c1 to c2 and ensure that the buffer size
             restrictions are honored.

           I believe being able to do this would have caught bugs like
           #12392. CConnman being instantiable like this would allow us to
           inspect why a CConnman instance might have stopped receiving data
           rather than just guessing based on pings and timing checks.

           I believe that if we achieve instantiable CConnman, a
           MockNetworkRouter would be quite easy.

2019-07-10 Four functional test runner ideas based on the IRC discussion at
           http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2019-07-10.html#l-262
           (lines 262 to 323).

           1. Fix passing wildcard args to the test runner from root and
              add an example to test/README.md about how to run wallet tests
              only (test_runner.py wallet*, etc)
              -> DONE in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16374

           2. Enable passing args like --rpc and --wallet to test_runner.py to
              run only those test categories
              -> DONE by promag in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16390

           3. Can one tell the runner to stop on failure? If not, add it

           4. Clean up the test arguments help info

           5. Improve test runner output
-----

2019-06-15 P2P ideas from Chaincode residency Day 2 p2p session with Suhas:
           - Multiple p2p networks instead of just one (James Chiang idea).
           - Use different IP buckets per peer (James Chiang idea). Each IP
             would have its own AddrMan table and would confer to ensure they
             don't have the same peer IPs, to avoid IP poisoning e.g. flooding
             by attacker peers.
           - Separate block relay from txn relay, e.g. separate them into 2
             networks. Suhas plans to make a PR to do that.
           - Improve p2p simulation frameworks: suhas, Jeremy Rubin, gleb
           - A better framework for systematically thinking about privacy.
           - Better simulations needed for evaluating Dandelion/++/Lite,
             contact Giulia Fanti.

13:51 < jnewbery> I liked aj's update to the getpeerinfo RPC here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15776/files#diff-618d3a4f4fc0dc851ec29218c445c148R109
13:52 < jnewbery> Because I like monitoring in general

13:53 < jnewbery> I'd also love to see more work on stuff like https://forkmonitor.info/nodes/btc to provide live monitoring of the network
13:53 < jnewbery> james o'beirne is planning to do some work on that, so if it's
        something that interests anyone here, please reach out to him

13:54 < jnewbery> I'd like to see more stress testing. Resource leaks like this
        are really difficult to catch in deterministic, short-running tests

           gmaxwell: any chance we have a bug where we don't fetch blocks from
           all out outbound peers while catching up? I've noticed a number of
           peers appear to be doing this. They startup behind, they're slow to
           respond like they're fetching blocks from someone, but they never
           fetch from me.

           wumpus: idk, don't think it necessarily fetches blocks from everyone
           during initial sync

           gmaxwell: IIRC it doesn't fetch from inbound peers, but I thought it
           fetched from all outbound

           and my PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16016
           and maybe https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15157 for tests

2019-05-01 Add tests for merged PR from Bitcoin Core Reviews Club #1:
           "Enhance `bumpfee` to include inputs when targeting a feerate"
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15557
           as per info in https://bitcoincore.reviews/15557.html

           harding: I think this PR probably could've used more tests, and
           contributions to testing are welcome independently from the PRs
           that implement the features. I took a quick look at the PR earlier
           and made notes about what I'd test for it:

2019-03-05 Feature requested: Change bumpfee to add inputs. Done with PR 15557?
           Mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15538

           promag: It was suggested bump fee could add an input to support the
           increased fee, which could result in a change output.

           instagibbs: It's a feature I've wanted to do for a while but required
           significant refactoring to do it the Right Way previously.
           Hoping someone in the residency can tackle it maybe.

                     with functional tests. They should cover high-level
                     functionality but they're not very good at catching this
                     class of bug. A stress-testing or soak-testing rig would be
                     more effective here.

2019-05-17 Ideas in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15870
           "wallet: Only fail rescan when blocks have actually been pruned"

           jamesob: Makes a lot of sense to allow rescanning for as long as we
           can as gmaxwell notes above - and it might even be prudent for most
           users to set a future-proofing prune value that reflects their disk
           limitations at startup time. Better that your node start pruning vs
           run out of disk space and exit. Maybe in the future we could default
           to it based on the datadir device if pruning-enabled-but-not-done-yet
           behavior is equivalent to a non-pruning node. Or introduce an
           "adaptive" pruning mode, which periodically polls for available disk
           space and adjusts the prune target accordingly..  "prune as little as
           possible and only until necessitated by lack of space." Some kind of
           adaptive prune to avoid hitting an out-of-disk error as long as
           possible.

           promag: The dump file contains timestamps so it could only throw this
           error if earliest is pruned - same for importmulti if timestamps are
           given. Especially when manual pruning. UPDATE: proposed by promag in
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16037 but why no tests added?

2019-05-13 jonasschnelli: I wasn't aware importmulti does not support private
           keys through descriptors. This will be fixed by the open PR

2019-03-11 IRC discussion: Ideas to improve -getinfo

           <wumpus>   I really want to improve -getinfo now that it's no longer
                      server side, e.g. show regtest/testnet/mainnet, make some
                      information per wallet

           <wumpus>   so if anyone has ideas let me know

           <gmaxwell> wumpus: pilfer ideas from that ncurses interface someone
                      did a while back?

           <wumpus>   maybe! to be clear I intend to keep it in JSON format,
                      just want to update for changes since 0.10 or so when it
                      last was deprecated and decided to never change it again

           <gmaxwell> well one thing in terms of cli usability maybe don't do
                      what many of our other info rpcs have done and put a
                      billion and one vaguely useful things so that when you run
                      them the good stuff scrolls off the top and its hard to
                      sort out anything useful. :P

           <wumpus>   removing stuff is open for suggestion too. I mean,
                      'improve' doesn't always mean 'creep any possible feature
                      into it'

           <gmaxwell> exactly. or alternatively, go fetch some useful fields out
                      of e.g. getblockchaininfo. I'll comment the next time I
                      get wall of texted when trying to get a frequently used
                      field.

           <wumpus>   I'd say a good requirement for information on it is that
                      it's dynamic, it's meant as a command for checking the
                      status after all, things that are only dependent on
                      one-time configuration might be better to leave off. I
                      mean, how useful is 'protocolversion' on there for
                      example? or 'keypoololdest', or settings like 'paytxfee'.
                      but, say, the hash of the most recent block would be
                      useful to have

           <fanquake> could change testnet: to something like network, then
                      specify main/test/reg ?

           <wumpus>   fanquake: yes exactly, that would be a simple and
                      non-controversial improvement. just grab
                      getblockchaininfo.main directly, eh, .chain

           <wumpus>   "verificationprogress" is also more or less useful, though
                      only during initial sync

           <gmaxwell> yea, I think what I mostly use getblockchaininfo is the
                      hash of the most recent block, and it's scrolled off...
                      do we have anything that returns the time of the last
                      updatetip?

           <fanquake> Maybe we could do something better for multiwallet use?
                      i.e at the moment walletversion and balance are both just
                      "null" if >1 wallet loaded. *same for keypool*.

           <wumpus>   fanquake: walletversion doesn't need to be in there at
                      all, but yeah, it should *list* wallets

           <gmaxwell> keypool shoudl probably be dropped.

           <wumpus>   gmaxwell: I don't think so

           <wumpus>   fanquake: the only interesting thing about the wallet in
                      getinfo is the balance, so it could be a object
                      {'walletname': balance} or such then it doesn't really
                      become longer as well

           <wumpus>   gmaxwell: do we even keep track of the time of an
                      updatetip?

           <sipa>     wumpus: IsInitialBlockDownload does iirc

           <wumpus>   sipa: ok - in that case it'd make sense to report that on
                      getblockchaininfo, I guess!

2018-09-12 Test coverage of the networking code
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14210

           Our python functional testing framework is pretty limited for what
           kinds of p2p behaviors we can test. Basically, we can currently only
           make manual connections between bitcoind nodes (using the addnode
           rpc), which are treated differently in our code than outbound peers
           selected using addrman.

           While we do have some unit-testing coverage of some of the components
           (like addrman, and parts of net_processing), I don't believe we
           currently are able to test the overall logic of how bitcoind uses
           those components (I recall this coming up when working on #11560,
           as a specific example).

           Anyway I am just mentioning this here as a potential project idea, as
           this is a material gap in our testing that I think would be valuable
           to work towards improving, and I wasn't sure how well known this is.

2016-08-09 Improving Parsing... mentioned in:

           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15586 (March 2019)

           marcof: in the long run we should make sure that arguments are
           parsed correctly and sanitized. this pr improves parsing of port
           numbers passed in by users.

           laanwj: improving *parsing* is a good thing, if we can factor that
           out I'd have no problem with it.

Subject: Removal of reject network messages from Bitcoin Core (BIP61)
Message-ID: <CABLeJxTuWa-Kaht3PgvwGN5Eb3GW=HpS7uNMESMcLpqn4BgN3Q@mail.gmail.com>

The reject message is helpful for figuring out why a tx was rejected.

It's not useful for determining success, yes. Particularly when doing
segwit/newer types of txs as there's always one or more pesky nodes who
still don't support it and send a reject message for perfectly good txs.

But after a delay where you haven't seen your tx propagated on the network,
it's useful to know *why* it failed.

What would be nice is actually expanding this error message. Currently with
RBF txs, 'fee too small' is sent for both original transactions as well as
replacement transactions. So a bug accidentally sending spent txos
(currently in mempool) says 'fee too small' instead of something more
appropriate like 'fee too small to supersede existing unconfirmed
transaction.'

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Removal of reject network messages from Bitcoin Core (BIP61)
Message-ID: <CAK51vgDO2Tg38XbW0pqAnO3ETJ_qf8owRsUYsTXmrf7H2yGZtw@mail.gmail.com>

Bitcoin Core may send "reject" messages as response to "tx", "block" or
"version" messages from a network peer when the message could not be accepted.

This feature is toggled by the `-enablebip61` command line option and has been
disabled by default since Bitcoin Core version 0.18.0 (not yet released as of
time of writing). Nodes on the network can not generally be trusted to send
valid ("reject") messages, so this should only ever be used when connected to a
trusted node.

->>> At this time, I am not aware of any software that requires this
feature, and I would like to remove if from Bitcoin Core to make the codebase
slimmer, easier to understand and maintain. Let us know if your application
relies on this feature and you can not use any of the recommended alternatives:

* Testing or debugging of implementations of the Bitcoin P2P network protocol
  should be done by inspecting the log messages that are produced by a recent
  version of Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core logs debug messages
  (`-debug=<category>`) to a stream (`-printtoconsole`) or to a file
  (`-debuglogfile=<debug.log>`).

* Testing the validity of a block can be achieved by specific RPCs:
  - `submitblock`
  - `getblocktemplate` with `'mode'` set to `'proposal'` for blocks with
    potentially invalid POW

* Testing the validity of a transaction can be achieved by specific RPCs:
  - `sendrawtransaction`
  - `testmempoolaccept`

* Wallets should not use the absence of "reject" messages to indicate a
  transaction has propagated the network, nor should wallets use "reject"
  messages to set transaction fees. Wallets should rather use fee estimation
  to determine transaction fees and set replace-by-fee if desired. Thus, they
  could wait until the transaction has confirmed (taking into account the fee
  target they set (compare the RPC `estimatesmartfee`)) or listen for the
  transaction announcement by other network peers to check for propagation.

I propose to remove "reject" messages from Bitcoin Core 0.19.0 unless there are
valid concerns about its removal.
