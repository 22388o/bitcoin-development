2019-08-12 Improve tooltip info in wallet-qt GUI:

           IRC #bitcoin question: "In the options for Bitcoin Core (GUI), what's
           'Allow incoming connections' for?  It's checked by default. The
           tooltip just repeats the text for the label. Can you *not* allow
           incoming connections? Won't that make Bitcoin not work?"

           IRC reply: "you have to enable listening to allow incomming
           connections. Also you will probably need to setup your router
           accordingly. If listening connections are not enabled, your node by
           itself only creates outgoing connections to other bitcoin nodes that
           has listening enabled."

2019-07-31 Test coverage of our networking code - Who is working on this?
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14210

           theuni: the idea is to be able to run multiple networking instances
           inside of one bitcoind process. It would be trivial to implement (I
           have it done in an ancient branch somewhere) the logic to spoof
           connection data inside of CConnman in order to simulate different
           test conditions. Phony IPs, fake latency, dropped packets, peer
           selection algorithm changes, etc. That's how these tests SHOULD
           work. Spinning up entire instances of bitcoind just to test net
           behavior is overkill. Time and energy would be better spent on
           finishing up the isolated CConnman instantiation.

           dongcarl: A minimal, motivating test case that should make the rest
           very easy. Here's what we came up with:

           - Instantiate a CConnman (call it c1) with a huge nSendBufferMaxSize
           - Instantiate a CConnman (call it c2) with a tiny nReceiveFloodSize
           - Start sending messages from c1 to c2 and ensure that the buffer size
             restrictions are honored.

           I believe being able to do this would have caught bugs like
           #12392. CConnman being instantiable like this would allow us to
           inspect why a CConnman instance might have stopped receiving data
           rather than just guessing based on pings and timing checks.

           I believe that if we achieve instantiable CConnman, a
           MockNetworkRouter would be quite easy.

2019-07-10 Appveyor seems to set wallet file permissions to 666 and not allow
           tests to change them. This caused me to do hacky workarounds in
           commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7195fa7. Why? What
           is Appveyor doing? Can it be fixed? If yes, propose a PR. Though this
           might be the case for security.

2019-07-10 Four functional test runner ideas based on the IRC discussion at
           http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2019-07-10.html#l-262
           (lines 262 to 323).

           1. Fix passing wildcard args to the test runner from root and
              add an example to test/README.md about how to run wallet tests
              only (test_runner.py wallet*, etc)
              -> DONE in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16374

           2. Enable passing args like --rpc and --wallet to test_runner.py to
              run only those test categories
              -> DONE by promag in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16390

           3. Can one tell the runner to stop on failure? If not, add it

           4. Clean up the test arguments help info

           5. Improve test runner output

2019-06-16 GUI wallet "Enter passphrase" and "Change passphrase" forms:
           Label the "Show password" and "Change password" checkbox buttons as
           "Show passphrases" and "Edit passphrases" instead, since there are
           2 or 3 fields and they are all labelled "passphrase" along with the
           description at the top of the form.

2019-06-15 P2P ideas from Chaincode residency Day 2 p2p session with Suhas:
           - Multiple p2p networks instead of just one (James Chiang idea).
           - Use different IP buckets per peer (James Chiang idea). Each IP
             would have its own AddrMan table and would confer to ensure they
             don't have the same peer IPs, to avoid IP poisoning e.g. flooding
             by attacker peers.
           - Separate block relay from txn relay, e.g. separate them into 2
             networks. Suhas plans to make a PR to do that.
           - Improve p2p simulation frameworks: suhas, Jeremy Rubin, gleb
           - A better framework for systematically thinking about privacy.
           - Better simulations needed for evaluating Dandelion/++/Lite,
             contact Giulia Fanti.

           gmaxwell: any chance we have a bug where we don't fetch blocks from
           all out outbound peers while catching up? I've noticed a number of
           peers appear to be doing this. They startup behind, they're slow to
           respond like they're fetching blocks from someone, but they never
           fetch from me.

           wumpus: idk, don't think it necessarily fetches blocks from everyone
           during initial sync

           gmaxwell: IIRC it doesn't fetch from inbound peers, but I thought it
           fetched from all outbound

           FEE BUMPING

2019-05-18 Remove `totalFee` from bumpfee functional tests. Refs:
           "Deprecate totalfee argument in `bumpfee`"
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15996
           and my PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16016
           and maybe https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15157 for tests

2019-05-01 Add tests for merged PR from Bitcoin Core Reviews Club #1:
           "Enhance `bumpfee` to include inputs when targeting a feerate"
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15557
           as per info in https://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/15557.html

           harding: I think this PR probably could've used more tests, and
           contributions to testing are welcome independently from the PRs
           that implement the features. I took a quick look at the PR earlier
           and made notes about what I'd test for it:
           https://gist.github.com/harding/168f82e7986a1befb0e785957fb600dd

2019-03-05 Feature requested: Change bumpfee to add inputs. Done with PR 15557?
           Mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15538

           promag: It was suggested bump fee could add an input to support the
           increased fee, which could result in a change output.

           instagibbs: It's a feature I've wanted to do for a while but required
           significant refactoring to do it the Right Way previously.
           Hoping someone in the residency can tackle it maybe.

2019-05-17 Verify/improve functional tests for open PR from Reviews Club #3:
           "Fix NOTFOUND bug and expire getdata requests for transactions"
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15834

           aj: There are tests in my older PR that you should be able to abuse:
               "Expire inflight GETDATA requests"
               https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15776

           jnewbery: I'd suggest checking with sdaftuar whether he's already
                     writing one. It's difficult to catch all problems like this
                     with functional tests. They should cover high-level
                     functionality but they're not very good at catching this
                     class of bug. A stress-testing or soak-testing rig would be
                     more effective here.

2019-05-17 Ideas in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15870
           "wallet: Only fail rescan when blocks have actually been pruned"

           jamesob: Makes a lot of sense to allow rescanning for as long as we
           can as gmaxwell notes above - and it might even be prudent for most
           users to set a future-proofing prune value that reflects their disk
           limitations at startup time. Better that your node start pruning vs
           run out of disk space and exit. Maybe in the future we could default
           to it based on the datadir device if pruning-enabled-but-not-done-yet
           behavior is equivalent to a non-pruning node. Or introduce an
           "adaptive" pruning mode, which periodically polls for available disk
           space and adjusts the prune target accordingly..  "prune as little as
           possible and only until necessitated by lack of space." Some kind of
           adaptive prune to avoid hitting an out-of-disk error as long as
           possible.

           promag: The dump file contains timestamps so it could only throw this
           error if earliest is pruned - same for importmulti if timestamps are
           given. Especially when manual pruning. UPDATE: proposed by promag in
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16037 but why no tests added?
-----

2019-05-13 jonasschnelli: I wasn't aware importmulti does not support private
           keys through descriptors. This will be fixed by the open PR
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15024. However, we should add
           something to the importmulti help (and backport).
-----

2019-05-11 Add tests, then rebase/update code for open PR from Reviews Club #2:
           "Allow all mempool txs to be replaced after a configurable timeout

2019-05-10 Make MAX_BLOCKFILE_SIZE, BLOCKFILE_CHUNK_SIZE and UNDOFILE_CHUNK_SIZE

2019-03-11 IRC discussion: Ideas to improve -getinfo

           <wumpus>   I really want to improve -getinfo now that it's no longer
                      server side, e.g. show regtest/testnet/mainnet, make some
                      information per wallet

           <wumpus>   so if anyone has ideas let me know

           <gmaxwell> wumpus: pilfer ideas from that ncurses interface someone
                      did a while back?

           <wumpus>   maybe! to be clear I intend to keep it in JSON format,
                      just want to update for changes since 0.10 or so when it
                      last was deprecated and decided to never change it again

           <gmaxwell> well one thing in terms of cli usability maybe don't do
                      what many of our other info rpcs have done and put a
                      billion and one vaguely useful things so that when you run
                      them the good stuff scrolls off the top and its hard to
                      sort out anything useful. :P

           <wumpus>   removing stuff is open for suggestion too. I mean,
                      'improve' doesn't always mean 'creep any possible feature
                      into it'

           <gmaxwell> exactly. or alternatively, go fetch some useful fields out
                      of e.g. getblockchaininfo. I'll comment the next time I
                      get wall of texted when trying to get a frequently used
                      field.

           <wumpus>   I'd say a good requirement for information on it is that
                      it's dynamic, it's meant as a command for checking the
                      status after all, things that are only dependent on
                      one-time configuration might be better to leave off. I
                      mean, how useful is 'protocolversion' on there for
                      example? or 'keypoololdest', or settings like 'paytxfee'.
                      but, say, the hash of the most recent block would be
                      useful to have

           <fanquake> could change testnet: to something like network, then
                      specify main/test/reg ?

           <wumpus>   fanquake: yes exactly, that would be a simple and
                      non-controversial improvement. just grab
                      getblockchaininfo.main directly, eh, .chain

           <wumpus>   "verificationprogress" is also more or less useful, though
                      only during initial sync

           <gmaxwell> yea, I think what I mostly use getblockchaininfo is the
                      hash of the most recent block, and it's scrolled off...
                      do we have anything that returns the time of the last
                      updatetip?

           <fanquake> Maybe we could do something better for multiwallet use?
                      i.e at the moment walletversion and balance are both just
                      "null" if >1 wallet loaded. *same for keypool*.

           <wumpus>   fanquake: walletversion doesn't need to be in there at
                      all, but yeah, it should *list* wallets

           <gmaxwell> keypool shoudl probably be dropped.

           <wumpus>   gmaxwell: I don't think so

           <wumpus>   fanquake: the only interesting thing about the wallet in
                      getinfo is the balance, so it could be a object
                      {'walletname': balance} or such then it doesn't really
                      become longer as well

           <wumpus>   gmaxwell: do we even keep track of the time of an
                      updatetip?

           <sipa>     wumpus: IsInitialBlockDownload does iirc

           <wumpus>   sipa: ok - in that case it'd make sense to report that on
                      getblockchaininfo, I guess!

2018-09-12 Test coverage of the networking code
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14210

           Our python functional testing framework is pretty limited for what
           kinds of p2p behaviors we can test. Basically, we can currently only
           make manual connections between bitcoind nodes (using the addnode
           rpc), which are treated differently in our code than outbound peers
           selected using addrman.

           While we do have some unit-testing coverage of some of the components
           (like addrman, and parts of net_processing), I don't believe we
           currently are able to test the overall logic of how bitcoind uses
           those components (I recall this coming up when working on #11560,
           as a specific example).

           Anyway I am just mentioning this here as a potential project idea, as
           this is a material gap in our testing that I think would be valuable
           to work towards improving, and I wasn't sure how well known this is.

2016-08-09 Improving Parsing... mentioned in:
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8394
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15586 (March 2019)

           marcof: in the long run we should make sure that arguments are
           parsed correctly and sanitized. this pr improves parsing of port
           numbers passed in by users.

           laanwj: improving *parsing* is a good thing, if we can factor that
           out I'd have no problem with it.

The reject message is helpful for figuring out why a tx was rejected.

It's not useful for determining success, yes. Particularly when doing
segwit/newer types of txs as there's always one or more pesky nodes who
still don't support it and send a reject message for perfectly good txs.

But after a delay where you haven't seen your tx propagated on the network,
it's useful to know *why* it failed.

What would be nice is actually expanding this error message. Currently with
RBF txs, 'fee too small' is sent for both original transactions as well as
replacement transactions. So a bug accidentally sending spent txos
(currently in mempool) says 'fee too small' instead of something more
appropriate like 'fee too small to supersede existing unconfirmed
transaction.'

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Removal of reject network messages from Bitcoin Core (BIP61)
Message-ID: <CAK51vgDO2Tg38XbW0pqAnO3ETJ_qf8owRsUYsTXmrf7H2yGZtw@mail.gmail.com>

Bitcoin Core may send "reject" messages as response to "tx", "block" or
"version" messages from a network peer when the message could not be accepted.

This feature is toggled by the `-enablebip61` command line option and has been
disabled by default since Bitcoin Core version 0.18.0 (not yet released as of
time of writing). Nodes on the network can not generally be trusted to send
valid ("reject") messages, so this should only ever be used when connected to a
trusted node.

->>> At this time, I am not aware of any software that requires this
feature, and I would like to remove if from Bitcoin Core to make the codebase
slimmer, easier to understand and maintain. Let us know if your application
relies on this feature and you can not use any of the recommended alternatives:

* Testing or debugging of implementations of the Bitcoin P2P network protocol
  should be done by inspecting the log messages that are produced by a recent
  version of Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core logs debug messages
  (`-debug=<category>`) to a stream (`-printtoconsole`) or to a file
  (`-debuglogfile=<debug.log>`).

* Testing the validity of a block can be achieved by specific RPCs:
  - `submitblock`
  - `getblocktemplate` with `'mode'` set to `'proposal'` for blocks with
    potentially invalid POW

* Testing the validity of a transaction can be achieved by specific RPCs:
  - `sendrawtransaction`
  - `testmempoolaccept`

* Wallets should not use the absence of "reject" messages to indicate a
  transaction has propagated the network, nor should wallets use "reject"
  messages to set transaction fees. Wallets should rather use fee estimation
  to determine transaction fees and set replace-by-fee if desired. Thus, they
  could wait until the transaction has confirmed (taking into account the fee
  target they set (compare the RPC `estimatesmartfee`)) or listen for the
  transaction announcement by other network peers to check for propagation.

I propose to remove "reject" messages from Bitcoin Core 0.19.0 unless there are
valid concerns about its removal.

Marco
