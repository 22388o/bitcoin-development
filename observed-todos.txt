2019-05-10 Make MAX_BLOCKFILE_SIZE, BLOCKFILE_CHUNK_SIZE and UNDOFILE_CHUNK_SIZE
           variable (either custom values for regtest or reducible via a debug
           parameter) in order to properly do functional testing for pruning.

2019-05-01 Add tests for merged PR from Bitcoin Core Reviews Club #1:
           "Enhance `bumpfee` to include inputs when targeting a feerate"
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15557
           as per info in https://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/15557.html

           harding: I think this PR probably could've used more tests, and
           contributions to testing are welcome independently from the PRs
           that implement the features. I took a quick look at the PR earlier
           and made notes about what I'd test for it:

2019-03-11 IRC discussion: Ideas to improve -getinfo

           <wumpus>   I really want to improve -getinfo now that it's no longer
                      server side, e.g. show regtest/testnet/mainnet, make some
                      information per wallet

           <wumpus>   so if anyone has ideas let me know

           <gmaxwell> wumpus: pilfer ideas from that ncurses interface someone
                      did a while back?

           <wumpus>   maybe! to be clear I intend to keep it in JSON format,
                      just want to update for changes since 0.10 or so when it
                      last was deprecated and decided to never change it again

           <gmaxwell> well one thing in terms of cli usability maybe don't do
                      what many of our other info rpcs have done and put a
                      billion and one vaguely useful things so that when you run
                      them the good stuff scrolls off the top and its hard to
                      sort out anything useful. :P

           <wumpus>   removing stuff is open for suggestion too. I mean,
                      'improve' doesn't always mean 'creep any possible feature
                      into it'

           <gmaxwell> exactly. or alternatively, go fetch some useful fields out
                      of e.g. getblockchaininfo. I'll comment the next time I
                      get wall of texted when trying to get a frequently used
                      field.

           <wumpus>   I'd say a good requirement for information on it is that
                      it's dynamic, it's meant as a command for checking the
                      status after all, things that are only dependent on
                      one-time configuration might be better to leave off. I
                      mean, how useful is 'protocolversion' on there for
                      example? or 'keypoololdest', or settings like 'paytxfee'.
                      but, say, the hash of the most recent block would be
                      useful to have

           <fanquake> could change testnet: to something like network, then
                      specify main/test/reg ?

           <wumpus>   fanquake: yes exactly, that would be a simple and
                      non-controversial improvement. just grab
                      getblockchaininfo.main directly, eh, .chain

           <wumpus>   "verificationprogress" is also more or less useful, though
                      only during initial sync

           <gmaxwell> yea, I think what I mostly use getblockchaininfo is the
                      hash of the most recent block, and it's scrolled off...
                      do we have anything that returns the time of the last
                      updatetip?

           <fanquake> Maybe we could do something better for multiwallet use?
                      i.e at the moment walletversion and balance are both just
                      "null" if >1 wallet loaded. *same for keypool*.

           <wumpus>   fanquake: walletversion doesn't need to be in there at
                      all, but yeah, it should *list* wallets

           <gmaxwell> keypool shoudl probably be dropped.

           <wumpus>   gmaxwell: I don't think so

           <wumpus>   fanquake: the only interesting thing about the wallet in
                      getinfo is the balance, so it could be a object
                      {'walletname': balance} or such then it doesn't really
                      become longer as well

           <wumpus>   gmaxwell: do we even keep track of the time of an
                      updatetip?

           <sipa>     wumpus: IsInitialBlockDownload does iirc

           <wumpus>   sipa: ok - in that case it'd make sense to report that on
                      getblockchaininfo, I guess!

           <bitcoin>  [bitcoin] fanquake opened pull request #15564:
                      cli: remove duplicate wallet fields from -getinfo

2019-03-05 New feature requested: Change bumpfee to add inputs
           Mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15538

           promag: It was suggested bump fee could add an input to support the
           increased fee, which could result in a change output.

           instagibbs: It's a feature I've wanted to do for a while but required
           significant refactoring to do it the Right Way previously.
           Hoping someone in the residency can tackle it maybe.

2018-09-12 Test coverage of the networking code
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14210

           Our python functional testing framework is pretty limited for what
           kinds of p2p behaviors we can test. Basically, we can currently only
           make manual connections between bitcoind nodes (using the addnode
           rpc), which are treated differently in our code than outbound peers
           selected using addrman.

           While we do have some unit-testing coverage of some of the components
           (like addrman, and parts of net_processing), I don't believe we
           currently are able to test the overall logic of how bitcoind uses
           those components (I recall this coming up when working on #11560,
           as a specific example).

           Anyway I am just mentioning this here as a potential project idea, as
           this is a material gap in our testing that I think would be valuable
           to work towards improving, and I wasn't sure how well known this is.

2016-08-09 Improving Parsing... mentioned in:
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8394
           https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15586 (March 2019)

           marcof: in the long run we should make sure that arguments are
           parsed correctly and sanitized. this pr improves parsing of port
           numbers passed in by users.

           laanwj: improving *parsing* is a good thing, if we can factor that
           out I'd have no problem with it.

Subject: Removal of reject network messages from Bitcoin Core (BIP61)
Message-ID: <CABLeJxTuWa-Kaht3PgvwGN5Eb3GW=HpS7uNMESMcLpqn4BgN3Q@mail.gmail.com>

The reject message is helpful for figuring out why a tx was rejected.

It's not useful for determining success, yes. Particularly when doing
segwit/newer types of txs as there's always one or more pesky nodes who
still don't support it and send a reject message for perfectly good txs.

But after a delay where you haven't seen your tx propagated on the network,
it's useful to know *why* it failed.

What would be nice is actually expanding this error message. Currently with
RBF txs, 'fee too small' is sent for both original transactions as well as
replacement transactions. So a bug accidentally sending spent txos
(currently in mempool) says 'fee too small' instead of something more
appropriate like 'fee too small to supersede existing unconfirmed
transaction.'

From: Marco Falke <falke.marco@gmail.com>
To: Bitcoin Protocol Discussion <bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org>
Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Removal of reject network messages from Bitcoin Core (BIP61)
Message-ID: <CAK51vgDO2Tg38XbW0pqAnO3ETJ_qf8owRsUYsTXmrf7H2yGZtw@mail.gmail.com>

Bitcoin Core may send "reject" messages as response to "tx", "block" or
"version" messages from a network peer when the message could not be accepted.

This feature is toggled by the `-enablebip61` command line option and has been
disabled by default since Bitcoin Core version 0.18.0 (not yet released as of
time of writing). Nodes on the network can not generally be trusted to send
valid ("reject") messages, so this should only ever be used when connected to a
trusted node.

->>> At this time, I am not aware of any software that requires this
feature, and I would like to remove if from Bitcoin Core to make the codebase
slimmer, easier to understand and maintain. Let us know if your application
relies on this feature and you can not use any of the recommended alternatives:

* Testing or debugging of implementations of the Bitcoin P2P network protocol
  should be done by inspecting the log messages that are produced by a recent
  version of Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core logs debug messages
  (`-debug=<category>`) to a stream (`-printtoconsole`) or to a file
  (`-debuglogfile=<debug.log>`).

* Testing the validity of a block can be achieved by specific RPCs:
  - `submitblock`
  - `getblocktemplate` with `'mode'` set to `'proposal'` for blocks with
    potentially invalid POW

* Testing the validity of a transaction can be achieved by specific RPCs:
  - `sendrawtransaction`
  - `testmempoolaccept`

* Wallets should not use the absence of "reject" messages to indicate a
  transaction has propagated the network, nor should wallets use "reject"
  messages to set transaction fees. Wallets should rather use fee estimation
  to determine transaction fees and set replace-by-fee if desired. Thus, they
  could wait until the transaction has confirmed (taking into account the fee
  target they set (compare the RPC `estimatesmartfee`)) or listen for the
  transaction announcement by other network peers to check for propagation.

I propose to remove "reject" messages from Bitcoin Core 0.19.0 unless there are
valid concerns about its removal.

Marco
