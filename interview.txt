Interview

Who am I/background
- Freelance software developer (and surfer) from the US, based mostly in France,
  often in Biarritz, sometimes Paris or NYC, doing software engineering, project
  management and even marketing for multinationals
- Speaks English, French, German, and some Russian
- Computer languages: BASIC, assembly, Ruby, Lisp/Common Lisp, some C and C++
- Engineering and business background (Harvey Mudd engineering, INSEAD MBA)
- Spent years in the computer game business and in the music business
- First heard of Bitcoin in 2013
- Starting following Bitcoin closely in 2016 and saving money to spend time learning
- Applied to Chaincode Labs in late February, told I needed to show some POW in the space
- Early March I began modestly contributing to Bitcoin Core
- A month later, Jonas and John at Chaincode Labs proposed a phone call to
  advise/provide orientation/answer questions
- 2 months after Jonas proposed joining the Chaincode Labs Bitcoin seminar in June
- Currently spending a few hours a week on Bitcoin Core
- Considering ways to work on it full time

Getting started working on Bitcoin Core
- Good resources and how to begin
- What kind of contributions are desired and needed
- How to review Bitcoin Core PRs
- How to begin contributing changes
- Warning: Be patient, context-aware, and don't take things personally
- How to sustain contributing without burning out
- What is unusual and exceptional in Bitcoin Core compared to other large,
  legacy OSS projects I've seen
  - Much context, history, specialised knowledge behind current state to assimilate
  - BDFL-free
  - Very small number of experienced reviewers and contributors
  - Process
  - Criticality
  - People care and are generous with their time
  - Humbleness and activism (why I'm here)

Bitcoin Core PR Review Club (John)

Bitcoin Optech (John, David, Mike, Steve)

Chaincode Labs summer Bitcoin seminar and residency (Matt, John, Jonas)
- Amazing place with amazing people
- Semi-depressing to return to normal life after ten days there!
- It makes business sense for OGs to protect their investment; patronage a la
  Chaincode can be one of the most effective and interesting ways to do so
- A similar structure should exist in Europe, if any smart OGs are interested

Square Crypto (Miles, Steve, Matt)

There is so much to do: Interesting developments in the Bitcoin Core codebase
- Modularity, for example further separating the node from the wallet (Russ)
- Multiprocess (Russ)
- Property-based testing (Chris Stewart and I)
- Fuzz testing (Marco)
- Faster functional tests from more modularity or change of PL
- Better test coverage of the P2P networking code
  - Might help catch bugs like #12392
  - See issue #14210
- Privacy improvements to the P2P networking (Suhas, Gleb):
  - Separating transaction relay from block relay
  - Need for better p2p testing tools and frameworks to evaluate how behaviour
  changes in complex state: Suhas, Gleb, Jeremy, Giulia
  - Multiple p2p networks instead of just one (James Chiang idea).
  - Use different IP buckets per peer (James Chiang idea). Each IP
    would have its own AddrMan table and would confer to ensure they
    don't have the same peer IPs, to avoid IP poisoning e.g. flooding
    by attacker peers.
  - Separate block relay from txn relay, e.g. separate them into 2
    networks. Suhas is working on that with PRs like 15759.
  - A better framework for systematically thinking about privacy.
  - Better simulations needed for evaluating Dandelion/++/Lite,
    contact Giulia Fanti.
- AssumeUTXO (James)
- Benchmarking (James)
- Builds (Carl, CFields)
- Plugging Rust components into Bitcoin Core?
- Projects worked on by each of the Chaincode Labs residents:
  -
  -
  -
  -
- Watch the IRC discussions, issues, and code reviews

Future plans and goals

End note - humble service
