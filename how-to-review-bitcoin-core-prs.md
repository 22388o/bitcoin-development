### INTRODUCTION

Reviewing and testing can be the best ways to begin contributing to Bitcoin
Core.

Experienced review and testing are regularly cited by long-term Bitcoin Core
developers as both

  - resource bottlenecks, and

  - the best and most helpful way to begin contributing and earning reputation
    in the community.

Yet the process and learning curve can seem intimidating and in practice very
few new contributors do it.

As a newcomer, this article represents my current understanding after a few
months, a few dozen PR reviews, a few issues tested or handled, and a handful of
commits.

Some of this understanding was gained from

  - contributing to a large open source project,
    [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails), and co-editing its blog and
    newsletter, [This Week in Rails](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/archive)

  - development and lead maintainership of
    [Ransack](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack),
    a popular Ruby search engine

  - daily discussions on this topic of mutual interest with my good friend and
    colleague, [Kasper Timm Hansen](https://twitter.com/kaspth), a developer at
    [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/about/team) and since 2016 a member of the
    [Ruby on Rails Core Team](https://rubyonrails.org/community/).

Yet much of it is unique to Bitcoin Core and came only with time. I would have
preferred to know these things from the start. So here we are. This is foremost
a self-study exercise, but perhaps it can be useful for others.

### TERMINOLOGY

[PR](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests): An acronym for
*pull request*, sometimes called a merge request. A proposed change to the code
or documentation in the source code repository.

[WIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process): An acronym for *work in
progress*.

[ACK, NACK, nit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review):
Defined [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review).


### GENERAL

As a newcomer, the goal is to try to add value, with friendliness and
humility, while learning as much as possible.

A good approach is to make it not about you, but rather "How can I best serve?"

One of the most challenging aspects facing new contributors is the breadth of
the codebase and the complexities of the technologies surrounding it.

Be aware of what you donâ€™t know; long-term contributors have years of experience
and context. The community has built up a deep collective wealth of knowledge
and experience. Keep in mind that your new ideas may have already been proposed
or considered several times in the past.

Remember that contributor and maintainer resources are limited -- ask for them
carefully and respectfully. The goal is to try to give more than you take, to
help more than hinder, while getting up to speed.

Follow the
[#bitcoin-core-dev](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitcoin-core-dev)
IRC channel and the
[bitcoin-dev](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev)
mailing list.

Before jumping in, take plenty of time to:

  - understand the contribution process and guidelines, not only by reading
    the documentation in the [repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin),
    notably
    [Contributing to Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    and everything in the
    [doc](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc) and
    [test](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/test)
    [directories](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/test),
    but also by observing interactions on the
    [#bitcoin-core-dev](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitcoin-core-dev)
    IRC channel and the ongoing
    [code review in the repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls)

  - get to know the maintainers and regular contributors: what they do, what
    they like and want, how they give feedback

Participate in the excellent
[Bitcoin Core PR Review Club](https://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/)
weekly meetings on IRC. The club was launched in May 2019 by
[John Newbery](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery). You'll benefit the most if you
prepare for each meeting in advance by studying, building, and testing the PR
under review -- and then actually reviewing it! Go through the notes, questions,
and logs of the previous meetings; there is gold in there.

Many newcomers begin by filing pull requests that add to the hundreds already
awaiting valuable review. In many cases, it may be better to begin by reviewing
the existing pull requests and starting to understand what kind of pull
requests and review are most helpful, while slowly gaining... the big picture.

THE BIG PICTURE

The big picture is much more important than nits, spelling, or code style.

Steps to improve understanding of the big picture:

- do the [Chaincode Labs study guide](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/study-groups)

- read and do [Programming Bitcoin](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin)

- study the [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/)
  (often referred to in singular form by the acronym "BIP"), and return to them
  frequently

- subscribe to the [Bitcoin Optech newsletters](https://bitcoinops.org/) and
read their [Scaling Book](https://github.com/bitcoinops/scaling-book)

- do [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line)

Aim for quality over quantity and a balance between deep work and quick wins.

Documentation is important, e.g. whether a function has a good description and
[Doxygen documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#coding-style-doxygen-compatible-comments)
for all its arguments, and high-level documentation of how
things work and interact.

Test coverage is essential; don't hesitate to improve or write any missing
[unit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/) or
[functional](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/test/functional/)
tests.

Be a contributor. Help PRs move forward by reviewing, [proposing
tests](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15996#issuecomment-491740946), or
fixes in a helpful way, proposing to rebase, or even offering to take over the
PR after months of silence. In short, help each other!

NITS

Try to avoid overly commenting in PRs about nits, minutia and code style,
particularly with PRs labeled as WIP, or when a PR has just been filed and the
PR author is mainly looking for Concept ACKs and Approach ACKs, e.g. general
consensus, not nitpicking.

Long-term contributors report that activity like this repels them, and it can
diminish your social capital on the project. Try to understand what kind of
review is needed and when to do what.

The best time for any nit comments is after the Concept/Approach ACKs and
consensus on the PR, and before the PR is finalized and has tested ACKs.

Give nits and style advice in a friendly, light, enabling way -- as in, feel
free to ignore, feel free to adjust if you happen to rebase, etc.

Keep in mind that no one is forced to take your review comments into account;
it's perfectly fine for the author to reply that they don't want to do something
if they feel it is outside the scope of the change, especially if your comment
is nitpicky.

SCALE UP

When you can, scale up the difficulty and priority of the PRs you review.

You can add more value and learn more by taking the time to do deep, quality
review of the [high-priority PRs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/8)
and the more difficult PRs. These PRs tend to intimidate people and can stagnate
for months, killing their author's motivation with death by a thousand cuts from
lack of quality review, nitpicking/code style bikeshedding, and rebase hell.
Reviewing them well provides a true service to Bitcoin.

The process of ramping up takes time; nothing can substitute for months and
years invested in gathering context and understanding from following the
[code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin),
[issues](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues),
[pull requests](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls),
[#bitcoin-core-dev](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitcoin-core-dev)
IRC channel, and the
[bitcoin-dev](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev)
mailing list.

STEP BY STEP

Keep ego and hopes out of the process. Don't take things personally and keep
moving forward.

When in doubt, assume good intentions.

Be patient with people and outcomes.

Persistence helps. Work on it every day.

These are all much easier said than done. Be forgiving with yourself and others.

John Newbery:

- A good rule of thumb is to review 5-15 PRs for each PR you make
- Start small
- Have a plan, don't spread yourself too thin
- Sharpen your tools
- Ask for and offer help, like rebasing for people or adding test cases
- People are generous with their time because they care
- Contribute by understanding what others want and being respectful


### TECHNICAL SPECIFICS

Become comfortable with
[compiling Bitcoin Core from
source](https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development/blob/master/how-to-compile-bitcoin-core-from-source-for-linux-debian.md)
and running the
[unit tests](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/test/README.md)
and
[functional tests](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/README.md)
since you will need to do it for each PR you review. For this, the Bitcoin Core
[productivity notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/productivity.md)
are indispensable.

Become adept at searching the repository with `git grep`. You'll use it
constantly.

Read and know the Bitcoin Core [developer notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md).

Be sure to learn and understand the [peer review
process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review).
The process is
[often](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15626)
[updated](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16149),
so refer back to it frequently.

Concept ACK means that the reviewer acknowledges and agrees with the concept of
the change, but is not (yet) confirming they've looked at the code or tested it.
This can be a valuable signal to a PR author to let them know that the PR has
merit and is headed in the right direction.

Manual testing of new features and reported issues is always welcome. A comment
that is really helpful in review: "Here's what I tested and my methodology",
particularly to back up an ACK.

Some PRs can be difficult to test or ACK due to complexity, context, or possibly
a lack of tests or simulation framework. That shouldn't discourage you from
reviewing. For example, if you've reviewed the code thoroughly, a comment like
"the code looks correct to me, but I don't feel confident enough about behaviour
to give an ACK" is a perfectly helpful contribution.

If you're not sure where to start:

While the PR is building and the unit and functional tests are running, read the
code, read the PR comments, then re-read both. Find something that doesn't make
sense and try to make sense of it. Repeat. Once it all starts to make sense, run
it on testnet and/or mainnet, see what happens, tail or search through the
relevant logs. Maybe add some custom logging, printf statements, or asserts;
it's always a privilege to add these into other people's code. Run the relevant
functional test and look through the debug logs. Try refactoring the code to be
better or prettier, and discover why that doesn't work. Expect it to take twice
as long as you planned it to. Yes, it's work.

While you're reviewing, adding tests yourself helps you understand the behaviour
and verify the changes, and you can send them to the author who can add them to
the PR. Proposing automated tests to the author is a really helpful way to start
contributing. Authors really appreciate it when someone reviews their PR and
provides additional tests. [Here's an
example.](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15996#issuecomment-491740946)

When giving an ACK, specify the commits reviewed by appending the commit hash of
the `HEAD` commit. The trustless way to do this is to use the hash from your
*local* checkout of the branch and *not* from the GitHub web page. That way,
unless your local tools are compromised, you ensure you are ACKing the exact
changes. This is also useful when a force push happens and links to old commits
are lost on GitHub.

A full ACK could look like: "ACK `fa2f991`, I built, ran tests, tested manually
by doing X/Y/Z and reviewed the code and it looks OK, I agree it can be merged."

The Bitcoin Core merge script currently copies all ACK comments into the merge
commit. Remember that anything you write in an ACK comment will be in git
history forever when the PR is merged.

*Don't trust, verify.* Minimize dependance on GitHub in your review process.
[Pull down the PRs
locally](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/productivity.md#reference-prs-easily-with-refspecs)
and do all code review in your local environment. This is only a minimum; some
Bitcoin Core contributors also sign and OpenTimestamp their ACKs. It's trivial
to sign your commits using the [OpenTimestamps Git
Integration](https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-client/blob/master/doc/git-integration.md).

In your local environment, review each commit separately using a difftool like
gitk or meld on Linux, or opendiff on macOS.

Bitcoin Core reviewers frequently use the [Apache voting
system](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html#expressing-votes-1-0-1-and-fractions)
in their comments. Here is an
[example](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11426#issuecomment-334091207).

As a new contributor, be cautious with giving a NACK. Assume by default that you
might lack understanding or context. If you do NACK, provide good reasoning.
[Here's one
example.](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12360#issuecomment-383342462)

When you disagree, state your point of view once and move on. Don't flood the
comments section, browbeat others or overreact. Remember that the most
important thing is probably not the issue being discussed, but your relationship
with the other contributors.

A complex PR usually requires 3-4 ACKs before merging.

The [Bitcoin ACKs](https://bitcoinacks.com/) web app dashboard is useful for
following PR and review activity.


fanquake:
- I have some core dev tools in https://github.com/fanquake/core-review
  It has guides on how to gitian build, review certain types of PRs, etc
  I still need to improve the docs and push up more stuff I have sitting locally
- There is also https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools
- Rough distro list for build-related changes:
  https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/blob/master/operating-systems.md

harding:
- In case it's helpful to anyone, I took a quick look at the PR and
[made notes about my review process and what I'd test
for](https://gist.github.com/harding/168f82e7986a1befb0e785957fb600dd)

harding's process:
1. Open PR in browser
2. Checkout PR in dev environment
3. Build
4. Run integration tests
5. During and after 2-4, make notes on what I need to review
6. Answer what questions I can by looking at the code
7. Start regtest node (or testnet or mainnet if necessary) and review actual
   operation matches my expectation from the code

John Newbery:

I always download the PR branch to my machine so I can build and review locally.
I don't use the github webpage to review, only to leave comments.

My git tools: https://gist.github.com/jnewbery/1d45a6b5e14b3f3fefe5942d0cc2608d

I've got a short script that checks out the PR branch and queries the github API
to add a description to that branch locally, that makes it easier when I have a
bunch of PRs checked out locally that I can run a `git branch` command and see
what they are

once I have the branch locally, I'll set off a build in a VM while I look
through the changes

first, I run something like `git log --oneline upstream/master..`
that gives me a list of all the commits in the PR branch, one per line

and then I use a one-liner, which I have bash aliased as git-review, that steps
through the commits one-by-one, printing the commit log to the console, then
opening my difftool program:

for commit in `git log master..HEAD --oneline | cut -d' ' -f1 | tac`; do git log -1 $commit; git difftool ${commit}{^,} --dir-diff; done

I'll look at the diff, and when I quit the difftool program, git-review will
step forward to the next commit

First run through, I'll just skim everything, reading the commit logs and
looking at the overall changes, so I get an idea of what the PR is doing

Then I'll go through again, but look at each commit in more detail,
reviewing every line in detail

I make extensive use of the functional tests by adding
`import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`
break points, and then manually running RPC commands on the nodes under test

I pull the PR description from the github API and then use it to label the branch

There's an attribute of a git branch called `description` that you can update
manually, my `gb` doesn't map onto `git branch` exactly, I do some formatting on
the output so it includes the description

I'm using vagrant, just the standard ubuntu bionic image.
I have a vagrant file that installs all the dependencies.

I run make check and the functional tests, not usually --extended because I'm
too impatient.

Here's my vagrant config (YMMV): https://github.com/jnewbery/btc-dev

A toolchain for bitcoind data files: https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcointools

MarcoFalke: to run functional tests in the gui, pass BITCOIND=bitcoin-qt

To turn on debug=net with the logging RPC: bitcoin-cli logging '["net"]'

If we need any more linters it should be to check for unexpected changes to
consensus code


### ABOUT MAKING PULL REQUESTS

When you do start contributing PRs, here are some guidelines:

Aim for quality over quantity and a balance between deep work and quick wins.

Read and know the Bitcoin Core [developer notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md).

Focus on user problems, actual bugs, and "used, but untested" methods that
affect outcomes and need tests.

Good ideas may often be found in the
[PR reviews](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls)
and
[#bitcoin-core-dev](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitcoin-core-dev)
IRC discussions.

Things to do and fix can also be found by searching for TODO and FIXME comments
in the codebase. An easy way to do this is to run `git grep "TODO\|FIXME"` on
the command line from root. Keep in mind that these comments can sometimes be
out of date.

I find it useful to keep a list of PR ideas in the form of [observed
todos](observed-todos.txt).

Avoid making trivial refactoring, style cleanup, or spelling PRs; these consume
valuable contributor and maintainer time, often for little gain. Code churn can
cause hidden new bugs and blurs the code history and git blame. Any code
refactoring needs substantial motivation, advantages, or simplifications.

Do not begin by trying to change consensus code; it is difficult and
dangerous territory. The goal of Bitcoin Core is to maintain the correct
consensus on the Bitcoin network -- all else is secondary.

Gather context about the change you have in mind. Has it already been proposed
in the past? Do issues or PRs about it already exist? (They probably do). Sleuth
a bit. Search the `git log -S` history. Look at the `git blame` of the code in
question and `git show` the commits. Check the GitHub file history. You'll see
who understands that part of the codebase and be contacted for questions or
review.

Test coverage is essential; don't hesitate to write any missing
[unit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/test) or
[functional](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/test/functional)
tests, or improve the
[fuzzing tests](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md) or
[benchmarking](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/benchmarking.md).

A Gregory Maxwell warning to test contributors: "Overly exact tests have greatly
diminished value if their exactitude turns them into hyper-active *something
changed* detectors, when they would otherwise be more useful as *something isn't
right* detectors if constructed more in terms of invariants instead of strict
behaviour."

Documentation is important, e.g. whether a function has a good description and
[Doxygen documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#coding-style-doxygen-compatible-comments)
for all its arguments, and high-level documentation of how things work and
interact.

In general, PRs that intelligently improve documentation and tests in a well
thought-out way tend to be well-received.

Don't rush. Give your work time to mature, revisit it with fresh
perspective, and iterate on it a few times before putting it out there and
asking for others' time. It might be a good rule of thumb to write several WIP
PRs for each one that you do file.

Consider also the timing of what is going on in the project in terms of
priorities and releases as well as your current status. If you already have a
few PRs open it may be best to close them or concentrate on having them merged
before adding yet another PR to the review stack. The idea of limiting open PRs
to 5 per contributor is occasionally raised; consider staying well under that.

Put the time in to make your PRs as easy to understand and review as possible:
Code, tests, documentation, good commit messages, relevant references, concise
explanations.

Give some thought to PR size and scope. Many contributors err on the side of
making their PRs too large and time-consuming to review. It is often better to
keep your PRs short and focused to make them easier and safer to review. This
may require splitting your work into several consecutive PRs.

As described in the Bitcoin Core
[contributing guide](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
prefix your PR title with the relevant area (e.g. `doc`,
`test`, `rpc`, `wallet`), and become comfortable with frequently rebasing your
commits to squash them. Rebasing is also frequently done to keep your commits
logical, separate, and easier to review. Even better, hygienic -- each standing
on their own without introducing regressions.

PR descriptions are often either too terse or too verbose. Write the essentials,
then take the time to make your PR description brief, clear, even
[pithy](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/pithy). In your PR
description, it's a smart habit to give reviewers tips on how to review and test
your changes: "Here's how to review this".

It is essential for commit messages and PR descriptions to explain *why*.
Summarizing "what" can be good too, but "why" is essential to review because if
the why doesn't make sense then the what probably doesn't matter. Sometimes
things seem self-apparent, but when in doubt no one was ever hurt by a little
more concise explanation.

Don't rely on markdown in your PR description for it to make sense, especially
strike-through formatting. The Bitcoin Core merge script will copy your PR
description to git history in the merge commit but the formatting will be lost.

For simple edits of existing commits, don't hesitate to squash your commits
before pushing, without waiting for the maintainers to ask you to do so.

Set up Travis CI on your own GitHub Bitcoin repository so that when you push a
branch or commit, the linter and continuous integration tests run. It can be a
good idea to verify that they are all green on your GitHub repository before
filing a PR. Unfortunately, the Travis CI is also currently very slow and times
out frequently, signaling false negatives.

At the moment, https://bitcoinbuilds.org runs more quickly and reliably than
the Travis CI (but runs fewer builds), so don't hesitate to consult it for early
initial feedback when you push a PR or changes.

You can sign your commits using the [OpenTimestamps Git
Integration](https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-client/blob/master/doc/git-integration.md).
It's easy to setup.

Remember that every time you comment on your PR after pushing, you're sending
notifications to the people who previously reviewed or commented on it. Respect
their time.

Learn how to get people to review your work when needed. It's a skill.

Persistence can pay off. Sometimes a PR succeeds on the second or
[third try](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16060) if the first ones
didn't see enough review and if there are valid reasons to continue.

In this case, [one idea seen in
practice](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16060#issuecomment-494142593)
is to recap various ACKs from the previous PRs, with GitHub usernames, to rope
in support for the new PR. If you do, be sure to do it in a comment -- not in a
commit message and not in the PR description.

Never put GitHub usernames in commits and PR descriptions; the latter because
usernames in the description are copied into the merge commit by the merge
script. This can cause endless annoying notifications for those concerned.

Add
[release notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#release-notes)
when appropriate. RPC-related release notes should refer to the RPC help for
details instead of substituting for full documentation, for example:
"Please refer to the RPC help of `getbalances` for details."

Ask yourself how others will see your PR. Try to only file PRs that people will
be motivated to review and that are worth merging, for both Bitcoin and your
track record. Your PRs will receive more attention from the contributors and
maintainers and be merged more quickly.

Scale up your PR contributions gradually in line with your ability and
understanding of the project, process, and codebase.

Continue to do more reviewing and testing than adding PRs to the backlog.
Reviewing 5 to 15 PRs for every PR you make is a good range.

If you are a good reviewer and begin building a reputation and appreciation for
your help in moving the project forward, maintainers and other contributors
may reciprocate by reviewing your work more quickly as well!

[long-standing](https://twitter.com/orionwl/status/1131564038444453889)
