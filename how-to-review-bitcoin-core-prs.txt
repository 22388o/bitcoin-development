INTRODUCTION

Reviewing is the best way to begin contributing

Experienced review and testing are regularly cited by long-term Bitcoin Core developers as both

  - resource bottlenecks, and

  - the best and most helpful way to begin contributing and earning reputation in the community

Yet the process and learning curve can seem intimidating and in practice very few new contributors do it.

As a newcomer myself, this article represents my current understanding after two months, a few dozen PR reviews (some more useful than others), a few issues tested or handled, and a handful of commits.

Some of this understanding was gained from years of contributing a large open source project, Ruby on Rails, co-editing the This Week in Rails newsletter (https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/archive), and co-developing and lead-maintaining a popular Ruby search engine, Ransack (https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack).

Yet much of it is specific to Bitcoin Core and came only with time. I would have preferred to know these things from the start.

This is foremost a self-study exercise, but perhaps it can be useful for others.


GENERAL

Be aware of what you don’t know; years of deep experience and context in the minds of the long-term contributors

Follow the bitcoin-core-dev IRC and mailing list

take the time to
  - understand the contribution process and guidelines
  - get to know the maintainers and regular contributors: what they do, what they like and want

concentrate on selflessly adding value with a humble approach

in general, focus on quality over quantity and a balance between deep work and quick wins

big picture > nits and code style

remember that contributor/reviewer resources are limited; ask for them carefully/respectfully

focus on user problems, actual bugs, and "used, but untested" methods that affect outcomes and need tests

review and help the high-priority and more difficult PRs that tend to intimidate and stagnate, killing authors' motivation with death by a thousand cuts from nits/code style comments, lack of quality review, and rebase hell

try to help PRs move forward by reviewing, proposing tests or fixes in helpful way, proposing to rebase, or even offering to take over the PR after months of silence; in short, help each other!

avoid filing refactoring and fixup/cleanup PRs and commenting in PRs about code style issues; activity like this actively repels multiple long term contributors and diminishes your social capital on the project

the best time for any nit comments is after the concept acks and consensus on the PR, and before the PR is finalised and has tested ACKs

no one is forced to take all review comments into account; it's perfectly fine to say that you don't want to do something in a PR if you feel it is outside the scope of the change, including/especially if it seems nitpicky

take nits and style advice in a purely advisory way (as in, feel free to adjust if you happen to rebase, otherwise don't bother).. do any style adjustments before merging and not necessarily right away

documentation is important, e.g. whether a function has a good description and Doxygen documentation for all its argument, and high-level documentation of how things work and interact

test coverage is essential; write any missing unit or functional tests

in general PRs that intelligently improve documentation and tests tend to be well-received

do not begin by trying to change consensus code; it is difficult and dangerous territory

the goal of bitcoin core is to maintain the correct consensus on the bitcoin network, all else is secondary

it takes time; nothing can substitute for time invested in gathering context and understanding from reading the code, issues, PRs/reviews, core dev IRC and mailing list

keep ego and hopes out of the process, don't take things personally and move forward

when in doubt, assume good intentions

be patient with people and outcomes

work on it every day

these are all much easier said than done. be forgiving with yourself and others



jnewbery: a good rule of thumb is to review 5-10 PRs for each PR you make
          Start small
          Have a plan, don't spread yourself too thin
          Sharpen your tools
          Ask for and offer help, like rebasing for people or adding test cases
          People are generous with their time because they care
          Contribute by understanding what others want and being respectful
          Learn to get people to review when needed

gmaxwell: Avoid doing review that is inconsistent or focused on minutia or code
          style, especially if it comes across as oppressive rather than
          enabling



TECHNICAL SPECIFICS

never put GitHub usernames in commits; this causes endless notifications

release notes should refer to the RPC help for details instead of substituting for full documentation, example "Please refer to the RPC help of `getbalances` for details."

to run functional tests in the gui, pass BITCOIND=bitcoin-qt

to turn on debug=net with the logging RPC: bitcoin-cli logging '["net"]'

if we need any more linters it should be to check for unexpected changes to consensus code

concept ACK means that the reviewer acknowledges and agrees with the concept of
the change, but is not (yet) confirming they've looked at the code or tested it.

this can be a valuable signal to a PR author to let them know that the PR has
merit and is headed in the right direction.


manual testing of new features is always welcome.

while you're reviewing, adding tests yourself helps you understand the behaviour and you can send them to the author who can add them to the PR too

contributing automated tests to the PR author is a really helpful way to start
contributing

authors really appreciate it when someone reviews the pr and provides additional tests

a comment that is really helpful in review: "here's what I tested and my methodology"

jnewbery/instagibbs:
- check out the branch locally
- run a difftool on each commit in turn using meld on linux and opendiff on mac
- ACK the commit hash of the HEAD commit from my local checkout of the branch,
  so unless my local tools are compromised, I know I'm ACKing the exact changes.
  it's useful when a force push happens and links to old commits are lost on GH.
- though unless you gpg sign the ACK, GH could just modify what you're saying :)
- if you want to fully remove trust, you can go the full Marco Falke and
  sign/opentimestamp all of your review comments :)

aj:
i find "gitk" useful for getting an overview of changes

fanquake:
- I have some core dev tools in https://github.com/fanquake/core-review
  It has guides on how to gitian build, review certain types of PRs, etc.
  I still need to improve the docs and push up more stuff I have sitting locally.
- There is also https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools
- Rough distro list for build-related changes:
  https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/blob/master/operating-systems.md

BIP 125 describes bitcoin core's mempool policy for allowing txs to be replaced:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki


harding: In case it's helpful to anyone, I took a quick look at the PR and
made notes about what I'd test for it:

https://gist.github.com/harding/168f82e7986a1befb0e785957fb600dd

harding's process:

1. Open PR in browser
2. Checkout PR in dev environment
3. Build
4. Run integration tests
5. During and after 2-4, make notes on what I need to review
6. Answer what questions I can by looking at the code
7. Start regtest node (or testnet or mainnet if necessary) and review actual
   operation matches my expectation from the code


CREDITS

This article includes observed comments by the following Bitcoin Core contributors/maintainers who deserve to be credited: Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, and Gregory Maxwell.

A special thank you to John Newbery for creating and running the Bitcoin Core PR Reviews Club (https://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/) and to the Core contributors who participated so far: Dave Harding, Anthony Towns, Gregory Sanders, Michael Ford, and Marco Falke.

Over the years I had become disillusioned by the central influence of BDFLs in some programming languages and open source projects. Wladimir van der Laan's humble service to Bitcoin sparked the initial idea in my head of doing the same.

Finally, a big thank you to the Core contributors for their patience and receptivity with my stumbling review attempts so far, notably John Newbery, Marco Falke, João Barbosa, practicalswift, Gregory Sanders, Jonas Schnelli, Pieter Wuille and Wladimir J. van der Laan, and to Adam Jonas and John Newbery for their guidance and advice from the start.
