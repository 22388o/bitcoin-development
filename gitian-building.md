## Gitian Building

Last updated: July 31, 2020

*This is based on fanquake's
[gitian-building](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/blob/master/gitian-building/README.md)
resource that I initially updated in January 2020 with info and changes that I
found helpful when using it for the first time. Since then, I continue to update
this resource regularly.*

Bitcoin Core releases are [reproducibly built](https://reproducible-builds.org)
using [Gitian Builder](https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder).


If you have already set up your environment to build gitian signatures, you can
skip directly to [Make base VM for
gitian-building](#make-base-vm-for-gitian-building) below.


## Initial Dependencies

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt install coreutils # if coreutils is not already included in your distribution
```

### macOS

```bash
brew install coreutils
```

Gitian-builder needs `sha256sum`, which doesn't exist on macOS.

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/gsha256sum /usr/local/bin/sha256sum
```

```bash
brew cask install docker
```

### All platforms

- To install Docker, see the information for your platform here: [Docker Engine
  overview](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
- For the [build script](#build-unsigned-sigs) below to function, Linux users
  may need to [allow Docker to run as a non-root
  user](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).
- Once Docker is installed, run it at least once (e.g. with `docker run
  hello-world` or by opening the app) so Docker can request and set up the
  necessary permissions.
- You might want to give Docker access to more CPUs, RAM, etc. This can be done
  by going to `Preferences -> Advanced` in the app and allocating as required.


## Initial Setup

```bash
mkdir gitian-building
pushd gitian-building
```

Fork and clone a copy of the
[gitian.sigs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs) repository.

```bash
# After forking https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/gitian.sigs.git
```

Clone the other required repositories.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
git clone https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git
git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-detached-sigs.git # sigs for macOS and Windows only
```

Download the gitian inputs/dependencies into gitian-builder.
```bash
pushd gitian-builder
make -C ../bitcoin/depends download SOURCES_PATH=`pwd`/cache/common
mkdir -p inputs
wget -P inputs https://bitcoincore.org/cfields/osslsigncode-Backports-to-1.7.1.patch
wget -O osslsigncode-2.0.tar.gz -P inputs https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode/archive/2.0.tar.gz
wget -P inputs https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/osslsigncode/osslsigncode/osslsigncode-1.7.1.tar.gz
wget -P inputs https://bitcoincore.org/depends-sources/sdks/MacOSX10.14.sdk.tar.gz
popd
```

## Make base VM for gitian-building

```bash
pushd gitian-builder
bin/make-base-vm --suite bionic --arch amd64 --docker
popd
```

## Set up and check out the branches to build

You can run the following git command from within your local bitcoin repository
to see the Bitcoin Core release tags and descriptions, ordered by most recent
last.

```bash
git tag -n | sort -V
```

Update the version and signer values with the version to build and your username.

```bash
export VERSION=0.20.1
export SIGNER=your_username
export USE_DOCKER=1

pushd gitian.sigs
git checkout -b $SIGNER-$VERSION
popd

pushd bitcoin
git checkout v$VERSION
popd
```

## Build Unsigned Sigs

```
pushd gitian-builder
```

The first time `depends` is built for a new version, it can take a *long* time,
as [dependencies](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/depends/packages)
are being built for all architectures and operating systems. Subsequent builds
will be much faster, as only Bitcoin Core is being compiled.

Follow build progress using:

```bash
tail -f var/install.log # Setup
tail -f var/build.log # Building dependencies and Bitcoin Core
```

Adjust `num-make` and `memory` as needed below.

### Linux

```bash
bin/gbuild --num-make 5 --memory 12000 --commit bitcoin=v${VERSION} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml
bin/gsign --signer "$SIGNER" --release ${VERSION}-linux --destination ../gitian.sigs/ ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml
mv build/out/bitcoin-*.tar.gz build/out/src/bitcoin-*.tar.gz ../
```

### Windows

```bash
bin/gbuild --num-make 5 --memory 12000 --commit bitcoin=v${VERSION} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win.yml
bin/gsign --signer "$SIGNER" --release ${VERSION}-win-unsigned --destination ../gitian.sigs/ ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win.yml
mv build/out/bitcoin-*-win-unsigned.tar.gz inputs/bitcoin-win-unsigned.tar.gz
mv build/out/bitcoin-*.zip build/out/bitcoin-*.exe ../
```

### macOS

```bash
bin/gbuild --num-make 5 --memory 12000 --commit bitcoin=v${VERSION} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
bin/gsign --signer "$SIGNER" --release ${VERSION}-osx-unsigned --destination ../gitian.sigs/ ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
mv build/out/bitcoin-*-osx-unsigned.tar.gz inputs/bitcoin-osx-unsigned.tar.gz
mv build/out/bitcoin-*.tar.gz build/out/bitcoin-*.dmg ../
```

```
popd
```

## Commit Unsigned Sigs

```bash
pushd gitian.sigs
git add .
git commit -m "$SIGNER $VERSION unsigned"
git push
popd
```

## Build Signed Sigs - macOS and Windows only

Signed signatures can be built once the `detached sigs` are available in the
[detached-sigs repo](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-detached-sigs/).

```
pushd gitian-builder
```

### macOS

```bash
bin/gbuild -i --commit signature=v${VERSION} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx-signer.yml
bin/gsign --signer "$SIGNER" --release ${VERSION}-osx-signed --destination ../gitian.sigs/ ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx-signer.yml
bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs/ -r ${VERSION}-osx-signed ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx-signer.yml
mv build/out/bitcoin-osx-signed.dmg ../bitcoin-${VERSION}-osx.dmg
```

### Windows

```bash
bin/gbuild -i --commit signature=v${VERSION} ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml
bin/gsign --signer "$SIGNER" --release ${VERSION}-win-signed --destination ../gitian.sigs/ ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml
bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs/ -r ${VERSION}-win-signed ../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml
mv build/out/bitcoin-*win64-setup.exe ../bitcoin-${VERSION}-win64-setup.exe
```

```
popd
```

## Commit Signed Sigs

```bash
pushd gitian.sigs
git add .
git commit -m "$SIGNER $VERSION signed"
git push
popd
```

Done üçª


## One-off builds

You can invoke one-off builds using:

```bash
pushd gitian-builder

env USE_DOCKER=1 ./bin/gbuild -j8 -m 6000 \
--commit bitcoin=79218eae27f62e246d52dc6cda4e8846293e1c8e \
--url bitcoin=https://github.com/fanquake/bitcoin.git \
path/to/bitcoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
```

Useful for testing PRs like [#17787](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17787).
